            <h2>Afang Soup Nigerian Recipe</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Nigerian Afang Soup, like the Edikang Ikong soup, is native to the Efiks, people of Akwa Ibom and
                Cross River states of Nigeria but enjoyed by all Nigerians. It is also very nutritious as the soup
                consists mainly of vegetables. Afang Soup is prepared with a generous quantity of Water leaves and the
                wild herbal Okazi leaves.

            <h3>Notes on the ingredients</h3>
            <p>
                1. Great alternative to water leaves is Lamb's Lettuce, known as Canonigos in Spanish.
                <br>
                2. Yes, you need that much palm oil. ðŸ™‚
            </p>
            <h3>Before you cook the Nigerian Afang Soup</h3>
            <p>
                1. Wash, drain and slice the water leaves into tiny pieces. Grind or pound the sliced Okazi leaves. In
                Nigerian markets, the sellers of these sliced Okazi leaves have a machine for grinding it. You can also
                grind it with your blender with a small quantity of water. Take a look at the ground Okazi leaves.
                <br>
                2. Grind your pepper and crayfish and cut the onions into tiny pieces.
